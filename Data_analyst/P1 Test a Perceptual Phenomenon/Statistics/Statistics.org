** DONE Lesson 1: Intro to Research Methods
CLOSED: [2016-05-27 Fri 21:22]

*** BBC: bbcfacememorytest
*** Constructs : define and measure construct
*** Simple Averages
population Average: mu
sample Average : xbar
sampling error = mu - xbar
*** Randomness
logic of chance by John Venn in 1888 (meaning of random)
*** Visualize relationship
Scatter plot : individual points
*** Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention
 Correlation does not imply Causation.
*** Causal Inference
Survey and Experiments
Blind an Double Blind research
*** Random Assignment
with larger groups

** TODO Lesson 2: Visualizing Data
** DONE Lesson 3: Central Tendency
CLOSED: [2016-06-06 Mon 10:27]

*** More than one Mode ?

** DONE Lesson 4: Variability
CLOSED: [2016-06-06 Mon 13:19]
*** Cut of the first and third quartile ( 25%)
**** find the median of the first half (Q1) and the second half(Q3)
**** Interquartile Range (IQR) = Q3 - Q1
*** Q3 + 1.5*IQR < Outlier < Q1 - 1.5*IQR
*** Boxplots
*** Variance:  Average Squared Deviation , Average absolute Deviation
*** Standard Deviation : sqrt(variance)
*** Bessel's Correction : Squared deviation divide by (n-1) instead of n for calculating sample sd.
** DONE Lesson 5: Standardizing
CLOSED: [2016-06-06 Mon 16:52]
*** Z-score : (x-mu)/sigma
*** for new distribution mean = 0, sd = 1
*** Standard Normal Distribution
** DONE Lesson 6: Normal Distribution
CLOSED: [2016-06-06 Mon 16:41]
*** PDF: Probability Density Function
Area Under the Standard Distribution gives the probability
*** Z-table
** DONE Lesson 7: Sampling Distribution
CLOSED: [2016-06-06 Mon 16:41]
*** Compare Sample Means
*** [[http://www.wolframalpha.com][wolframalpha]] :  cool site see the distribution from datapoints
*** Central Limit Theorem (for sample distribution of means )
**** Mean of sample = Mean of population
**** sd of population(mu) / sd od sample(SE) = sqrt(sample size)
**** SE is also called Standard Error.

** DONE Lesson 8: Estimation
CLOSED: [2016-06-06 Mon 20:32]
*** Mean of treated population
**** point estimator : mean of the sample with our assumption
*** margin of error = 2*(sigma)/sqrt(n) exactly : 1.96 in place of 3
*** Interval Estimate of the population: xbar@margin of error
(95% confidence interval for the mean)
*** 98% CI ( Confidence Interval ) (z=2.33)
*** Y% of CI : xbar @ z*SE 
xbar: point estimator
SE: Standard Error(sigma/sqrt(n))
z= number of standard deviation away from the mean
z*SE = margin of error
** TODO Lesson 9: Hypothesis Testing
*** Levels of likelihood (Alpha Levels)
if the probability is less than
**** 0.05(5%)
**** 0.01(1%)
**** 0.001(0.1%)
*** Z-critical value and critical region (corresponding to an alpha)
