** Data Analysis Process
*** Questioning Phase
**** Characteristic of data (student who pass the course)
**** Things to be predicted
*** Wrangling Phase
**** Data Acquisition
**** Data Cleaning
*** Explore Phase
**** Build Intuition
**** Find Patterns
*** Drawing Conclusion Phase (Prediction)
**** Use Statistics and machine learning
*** Communication Phase
**** Blog Post
**** Paper,email, power-point,conversation
**** Data Visualization
** Download Anaconda
** Data Acquisition
*** Downloading files
*** Accessing API
*** Scraping a webpage
*** Combine data fron different formats
** CSV Format
*** comma separated values
*** list of rows (with each row as list or dictionary)
*** python-unicodecsv and csv modules
def read_csv(filename):
    with open(filename, 'rb') as f:
        reader = unicodecsv.DictReader(f)
        return list(reader)

enrollments = read_csv('enrollments.csv')
daily_engagement = read_csv('daily_engagement.csv')
project_submissions = read_csv('project_submissions.csv')
*** iterators in python
**** For loops loop over iterables.
**** iterables have __iter__ functions
**** __iter__ functions return Iterators
**** Iterators make use of the next method to move from element to element within their associated iterable
**** once an iterator runs out of things to return from the next function it raises the StopIteration exception whenever next is called
** Fixing Data type
*** datetime.strptime(date,format),float(),  int() , 'True/False' =='True' , etc
** Questioning about Student data
*** how long to submit the project
*** how do students who pass the project differ from who don't ?
*** how much time students spend taking classes
*** how time spent relates to the lesson/projects completed.
*** how engagement changes over time
*** how many times student submit before they pass
** Investigating the data
*** find the total number of rows in the csv and the number of unique student
len(enrollments)

unique_enrolled_students = set()
for enrollment in enrollments:
    unique_enrolled_students.add(enrollment['account_key'])
len(unique_enrolled_students)
*** Identify problems, surprising points in the data
*** avg minutes spend and avg lessons completed in first week
** Drawing Conclusion Phase
*** Conclusion may be due to true difference or noise in the data
*** Use Statistics to find out this
** Correlation does not imply causation
*** there might be a third factor causing both
*** Run A/B Test to find out
** Making Prediction
*** Machine learning can make prediction automatically
*** gives you the ranking of the features which are more important
** Communication Phase
*** which findings are most interesting ?
*** How to report them ?
** Visualizing Data
*** Matplotlib, Seaborn to make plot nicer, hisograms
*** Add title , axis labels bins etc.
** Data Analysis and Related Terms
*** Data Science
**** more focused on building system. eg. moive recommendation etc (blogs are on data analysis)
**** more experience
*** Data Engineering
**** More on data Wrangling
**** Involves data storage and processing  (less on conclusion)
*** Big Data
**** Fuzzy term for " a lot" of data
**** data scientists, analysts, engineers all work with big data.
** Over
*** Go for NumPy and Pandas.
